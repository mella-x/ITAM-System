# ITAM Project Analysis and Architecture Plan

## Current Codebase Analysis

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 5.1.6 with Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Vue.js (minimal setup in frontend_vue directory)
- **Authentication**: Django Allauth with custom user model
- **Additional**: Celery for background tasks, Redis for caching, Stripe for payments

### Existing Apps Structure
1. **users** - Custom user authentication and management
2. **revaluar** - Main business logic (company management, portfolios)
3. **inventory** - Current inventory management system
4. **ai** - AI integration features
5. **api** - REST API endpoints
6. **shopify** - Shopify integration

### Key Findings
- Well-structured Django project with proper app separation
- Custom user model already implemented
- Payment system (Stripe) already integrated
- Email system configured
- Bootstrap templates exist but need modernization

## ITAM Requirements (Based on AssetTiger Analysis)

   - Asset registration and tracking
   - Asset categories (Hardware, Software, Network Equipment, etc.)
   - Asset lifecycle management (Purchase → Active → Maintenance → Retired)
   - Asset location tracking
   - Asset assignment to users/departments

2. **User & Department Management**
   - Employee/user management
   - Department/location management
   - Asset assignment tracking

3. **Maintenance & Service Management**
   - Maintenance scheduling
   - Service requests
   - Maintenance history tracking
   - Warranty management

4. **Reporting & Analytics**

5. **Dashboard & Overview**
   - Asset overview dashboard
   - Key metrics and KPIs
   - Alerts and notifications

## Architecture Decision

### Backend Strategy
- **Keep Django**: The existing Django structure is solid and well-configured
- **Refactor Apps**: Transform the inventory app into a comprehensive ITAM system
- **API-First**: Build robust REST APIs for frontend consumption
- **Maintain Authentication**: Keep the existing user system and add role-based permissions

### Frontend Strategy
- **Vue.js SPA**: Build a modern single-page application
- **Component-Based**: Create reusable components for forms, tables, dashboards
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-friendly interface
- **Modern UI**: Use a component library like Vuetify or Quasar

### Database Schema Plan
- **Assets Table**: Core asset information
- **Asset Categories**: Hierarchical categorization
- **Locations**: Physical locations and departments
- **Assignments**: Asset-to-user assignments
- **Maintenance Records**: Service and maintenance history
- **Vendors/Suppliers**: Vendor management
- **Contracts**: Warranty and service contracts

## Next Steps
1. Design detailed database schema
2. Plan REST API endpoints
3. Create Django models and migrations
4. Build API views and serializers
5. Develop Vue.js frontend
6. Integration and testing
